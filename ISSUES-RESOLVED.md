# Job Tracker Extension - Fixed Issues

## ✅ Problems Resolved

### 1. Minification Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: Service worker was being over-compressed causing debugging issues
- **Solution**: Added sourcemaps for better debugging while maintaining production optimization

### 2. API Configuration Fixed
- **Problem**: GraphQL endpoint was pointing to placeholder URL `https://your-api-domain.com/graphql`
- **Solution**: Added mock mode that simulates successful API responses for development

### 3. Mock Data Mode Added
- **Current State**: `USE_MOCK_DATA = true` in service worker
- **Functionality**: Form submissions now work and return realistic mock data
- **Console Logging**: Clear debug messages show mock operations

## 🧪 Testing Your Extension

1. **Reload Extension**: Go to `chrome://extensions/` and reload your extension
2. **Open Developer Tools**: Right-click → Inspect on the job site
3. **Test Form Submission**:
   - Click the extension button to open the form
   - Fill in the fields (Name, Surname, Position, Company)
   - Click Submit
   - Check Console for mock data creation logs

## 📋 Expected Behavior

When you submit the form, you should see:
- Form shows "submitting..." state for 500ms
- Console logs: `🔧 [requestId] MOCK MODE: Simulating GraphQL response`
- Console logs: `✅ [requestId] Mock job application created: {data}`
- Form closes automatically on success
- No more JSON parsing errors

## 🔄 Switching to Real API

When you have a real GraphQL server ready:

1. **Open**: `src/background/service-worker.ts`
2. **Change**: `const USE_MOCK_DATA = true;` → `const USE_MOCK_DATA = false;`
3. **Update**: `const API_ENDPOINT = "https://your-real-api.com/graphql";`
4. **Rebuild**: `npm run build`

## 🐛 Debugging

With sourcemaps enabled, you can now:
- Set breakpoints in the original TypeScript code
- See readable function names in stack traces
- Console logs are preserved for debugging

## 📝 Mock Data Structure

The mock creates job applications with this structure:
```json
{
  "id": "mock_1693742400123",
  "name": "Your Input",
  "surname": "Your Input",
  "position": "Your Input or 'Software Developer'",
  "company": "Your Input or 'Test Company'",
  "status": "APPLIED",
  "createdAt": "2024-09-03T10:30:00.123Z"
}
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Test the form submission with mock data
2. Verify no more JSON errors appear
3. When ready, set up your real GraphQL backend
4. Switch off mock mode and configure real endpoints

The extension is now fully functional for development and testing!
